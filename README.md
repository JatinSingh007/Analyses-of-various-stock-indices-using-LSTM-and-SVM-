# Analyses-of-various-stock-indices-using-LSTM-and-SVM
Used 1 year and 10 year datasets of 5 indexes (NIFTY, DAX, NI225 and SSE) for analysis. Used genetic algorithm for feature selection and PCA for hyperparameter tuning and combined them with LSTM and SVM. Used wavelet transform for improving accuracy on 10 year dataset.
